# Samsung KernelSU late-load builds

The files in this directory are built from KernelSU `v3.2.5`, commit
`b0bc817b4e966aa6aa830834eaf6ef765d821d40`. They are not interchangeable
between KMIs.

## Versioned artifacts

| File | Target | KMI | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `android15-6.6_kernelsu-s25u-kdp.ko` | `SM-S938N`, `S938NKSUACZF1` | `android15-6.6` | Standalone reference module from the previously deployed S25U build |
| `ksud-s25u-kdp` | `SM-S938N`, `S938NKSUACZF1` | `android15-6.6` | Late-load binary embedding the 6.6 module |
| `android14-6.1_kernelsu-samsung-kdp.ko` | `SM-S721N` `S721NKSSCDZF3`; `SM-S921B` `S921BXXSFDZF2` | `android14-6.1` | Standalone Samsung KDP/RKP/DEFEX module with target `vermagic` |
| `ksud-samsung-android14-6.1-kdp` | Same verified 6.1 targets | `android14-6.1` | Late-load binary embedding the 6.1 module |

The standalone `.ko` files are retained for auditing. Root My Galaxy downloads
the corresponding `ksud-*` file because `ksud late-load` loads its embedded
`<kmi>_kernelsu.ko` asset.

The 6.1 files are build-verified but have not been run on either listed 6.1
device.

## Why the stock module crashes on Samsung

The original S25U failure was captured in
`ksu_mark_running_process_locked+0x154`: a generic inline `put_cred()` wrote
directly to a KDP-protected credential reference count. Samsung's kernel uses
`kdp_usecount_inc_not_zero()` and `kdp_usecount_dec_and_test()` for those
objects; bypassing that path caused a synchronous external abort.

Three other Samsung-specific conflicts were confirmed during the 6.6 port:

1. RKP rejected KernelSU's write to an unused syscall-table slot. The generic
   code nevertheless treated the dispatcher as installed, which redirected
   marked syscalls to the unchanged `ni_syscall` entry.
2. DEFEX retained its own task credential tuple. A KernelSU UID transition
   without synchronizing that tuple triggered credential violations, while
   Safeplace/Immutable-root killed KSU-domain helpers.
3. Late-load could not write a new `/data/adb/ksud` after the module changed the
   loader's security context. The failed destination remained a zero-byte file.

## Patch contents

[`patches/KernelSU-v3.2.5-samsung-kdp-rkp-defex.patch`](patches/KernelSU-v3.2.5-samsung-kdp-rkp-defex.patch)
contains the complete source delta from the tagged v3.2.5 tree:

- resolve Samsung KDP credential helpers and release protected credentials with
  `kdp_usecount_dec_and_test()` plus `__put_cred()`;
- install KDP credentials through `prepare_ro_creds()` on a root workqueue and
  update the target task with the firmware-native `kdp_assign_pgd()` path;
- synchronize the DEFEX task credential record after a successful transition;
- limit the DEFEX allow path to the current UID-0 task already in `u:r:ksu:s0`;
- record a syscall-table hook only if the RKP-protected write succeeds;
- when the dispatcher is unavailable, preserve Manager FD delivery with a
  `__arm64_sys_setresuid` kretprobe and provide sucompat through address-based
  syscall kprobes without modifying the syscall table;
- mark nested sucompat calls so a handler invoking the original syscall cannot
  recursively enter the same kprobe;
- stage `ksud` at `/data/local/tmp/.ksud-stage`, rename it onto the same
  `/data` filesystem before loading the module, then finish labels/assets after
  the module is active.

## 6.1 generalization

The first 6.6 implementation invoked an S25U-specific secure monitor command to
assign the task PGD and linked directly against the 6.6 DDK's
`kdp_usecount_dec_and_test` export. The 6.1 build removes both target-specific
assumptions:

- `kdp_assign_pgd(struct task_struct *)` is resolved from the running kernel and
  used as the firmware-native PGD update entry point;
- `kdp_usecount_dec_and_test(struct cred *)` is resolved at runtime, avoiding a
  dependency on a DDK-specific exported-symbol CRC.

Both function prototypes were verified against the S24 FE kernel BTF before
building. The same prototypes and every module-required symbol were then
checked against the recovered S921B DZF2 BTF and `vmlinux.elf` before sharing
the 6.1 artifact between the two profiles.

## Rebuild

Apply the patch to a clean v3.2.5 checkout:

```sh
git checkout v3.2.5
git apply KernelSU-v3.2.5-samsung-kdp-rkp-defex.patch
```

For the Samsung 6.1 module, use DDK image
`ghcr.io/ylarod/ddk-min:android14-6.1-20260313` and set:

```sh
CONFIG_KSU=m
CONFIG_KSU_SAMSUNG_KDP=y
CONFIG_KSU_SAMSUNG_RKP=y
CONFIG_KSU_SAMSUNG_DEFEX=y
```

The DDK image defaults to `6.1.166-dirty`, but the target has
`CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_LOAD=n`. Before building, replace the DDK's generated
`UTS_RELEASE` and `include/config/kernel.release` with the exact target release
`6.1.157-android14-11`. The resulting module must report:

```text
vermagic: 6.1.157-android14-11 SMP preempt mod_unload modversions aarch64
```

The exact container build used here was:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  -w /workspace/kernel \
  ghcr.io/ylarod/ddk-min:android14-6.1-20260313 \
  bash -lc '
    sed -i "s/6.1.166-dirty/6.1.157-android14-11/g" \
      "$KDIR/include/generated/utsrelease.h" \
      "$KDIR/include/config/kernel.release"
    make clean
    CONFIG_KSU=m \
    CONFIG_KSU_SAMSUNG_KDP=y \
    CONFIG_KSU_SAMSUNG_RKP=y \
    CONFIG_KSU_SAMSUNG_DEFEX=y \
    CC=clang make -j$(nproc)
    modinfo ./kernelsu.ko
  '
```

Run the generated symbol checker against the recovered target ELF before
stripping:

```sh
kernel/check_symbol kernel/kernelsu.ko /path/to/S721NKSSCDZF3/vmlinux.elf
kernel/check_symbol kernel/kernelsu.ko /path/to/S921BXXSFDZF2/vmlinux.elf
llvm-strip -d kernel/kernelsu.ko
```

Copy the stripped module to:

```text
userspace/ksud/bin/aarch64/android14-6.1_kernelsu.ko
```

Then rebuild `ksud` for `aarch64-linux-android`. The late-load binary and its
embedded module must always be published together.

On Windows with NDK r29, the build environment used was:

```powershell
$ndkBin = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk\ndk\29.0.14206865\toolchains\llvm\prebuilt\windows-x86_64\bin"
$env:PATH = "$ndkBin;C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.18.8-hotspot\bin;$env:PATH"
$env:LIBCLANG_PATH = $ndkBin
$env:CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER = "$ndkBin\aarch64-linux-android35-clang.cmd"
$env:CC_aarch64_linux_android = "$ndkBin\aarch64-linux-android35-clang.cmd"
$env:AR_aarch64_linux_android = "$ndkBin\llvm-ar.exe"
cargo build --release --target aarch64-linux-android -p ksud
```
